                            The problem, the contradiction the scientists are stuck with, is that of the mind. Mind has no matter or energy but they can't escape its predominance over everything they do. Logic exists in the mind. Numbers exist only in the mind. I don't get upset when scientists say that ghosts exist in the mind. It's that only that gets me. Science is only in your mind too, it's just that that doesn't make it bad. Or ghosts either.

                            Laws of nature are human inventions, like ghosts. Laws of logic, of mathematics are also human inventions, like ghosts. The whole blessed thing is a human invention, including the idea that it isn't a human invention. The world has no existence whatsoever outside the human imagination. It's all a ghost, and in antiquity was so recognized as a ghost, the whole blessed world we live in. It's run by ghosts. We see what we see because these ghosts show it to us, ghosts of Moses and Christ and the Buddha, and Plato, and Descartes, and Rousseau and Jefferson and Lincoln, on the on and on. Isaac Newton is a very good ghost. Ones of the best. Your common sense is nothing more than the voices of thousands and thousands of these ghosts from the past.

                          <p>
                          This comment was made after questions from Chris, the son of the main character, on whether ghosts exist. Like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarke%27s_three_laws">classic laws</a> from Arthur C. Clarke: "Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic", my take-away is that we should always be curious and open-minded to learn the new information and update our assumptions/understanding of the magic world we live in.</p>

                          <p>As they go further on the journey, Robert starts to think more about why John gets so frustrated when it comes to motorcycle maintenance even John is a talented drummer. Then, it comes to his mind, it's because the way they perceive the world is different. John holds more of a romantic view of the world, and the main character, on the other hand, perceives the world in a more classic way.</p>


                          <blockquote class="quote">A classic understanding sees the world primarily as an underlying form itself. A romantic understanding sees it primarily in terms of immediate appearance. The romantic mode is primarily inspirational, imaginative, creative, and intuitive. Feelings rather than facts predominate. "Art" when it is opposed to "Science" is often romantic. It does not process by reason or by law. It proceeds by feeling, intuition, and esthetic conscience. The classic style is straightforward, unadorned, unemotional, economical, and carefully proportioned. Its purpose is not to inspire emotionally, but to bring order out of chaos and make the unknown known.</blockquote>

                            <p>The logical statements entered into the notebook are broken down into six categories: (1) statement of the problem, (2) hypotheses as to the cause of the problem, (3) experiments designed to test each hypothesis, (4) predicted results of the experiments, (5) observed results of the experiments and (6) conclusions from the results of the experiments.</p>

                            <p>The real purpose of scientific method is to make sure Nature hasn’t misled you into thinking you know something you don’t actually know.One must be extremely careful and rigidly logical when dealing with Nature: one logical slip and an entire scientific edifice comes tumbling down.

                          <p>More often than not, in the type of research I do, I constantly work on finding when and why the proposed method does not perform well compared to the benchmarked methods. Then, improving the method until it can outperform most of the other benchmarked methods with significant gains and acceptable losses.</p>

                          <p>Nevertheless, this won't be the final stop of the research. There will always be more hypotheses (and therefore more improvements) we can test which might result in better work contributing to society.</p>

                            In Part One of formal scientific method, which is the statement of the problem, the main skill is in stating absolutely no more than you are positive you know.</p>

                            <p>What you should state is “Solve Problem: What is wrong with cycle?” and then state as the first entry of Part Two: “Hypothesis Number One: The trouble is in the electrical system.” You think of as many hypotheses as you can, then you design experiments to test them to see which are true and which are false.</p>

                            <p>Part Three, that part of formal scientific method called experimentation, is sometimes thought of by romantics as all of science itself because that’s the only part with much visual surface.</p>

                            <p>An experiment is never a failure solely because it fails to achieve predicted results. An experiment is a failure only when it also fails adequately to test the hypothesis in question, when the data it produces don’t prove anything one way or another. Skill at this point consists of using experiments that test only the hypothesis in question, nothing less, nothing more.</p>

                            <p>In the final category, conclusions, skill comes in stating no more than the experiment has proved.</p>

                        <p>The part I resonate the most is "An experiment is never a failure solely because it fails to achieve predicted results." Looking back to the work I have done, only fairly small portion of them made to publications; however, it did not stop me enjoying the work I do. Learning an interesting problem and trying to solve it has always been the cool/moist air and one deep breath makes me ready for the next one and then the next one.</p>

                        <blockquote class="quote">The formation of hypotheses is the most mysterious of all the categories of scientific method. Where they come from, no one knows. A person is sitting somewhere, minding his own business, and suddenly—flash!—he understands something he didn’t understand before. Until it’s tested the hypothesis isn’t truth. For the tests aren’t its source. Its source is somewhere else.

                        A lesser scientist than Einstein might have said, “But scientific knowledge comes from nature. Nature provides the hypotheses.” But Einstein understood that nature does not. Nature provides only experimental data.</blockquote>

                        But there it was, the whole history of science, a clear story of continuously new and changing explanations of old facts.

                        The purpose of scientific method is to select a single truth from among many hypothetical truths. That, more than anything else, is what science is all about. But historically science has done exactly the opposite. Through multiplication upon multiplication of facts, information, theories and hypotheses, it is science itself that is leading mankind from single absolute truths to multiple, indeterminate, relative ones.
